## The Big Picture



### The Big Picture
#### _What Is It?_
A simple practice used to visualise all the steps that a software pipeline goes through in moving code from source (eg git), through compile and test then into the hands of our Happy Users.

#### Why use The Big Picture?
Benefits of using Everything as Code principles:

* **Shared Understanding**: When the whole team collaborates around making the Big Picture they get a shared sense of how their pipelines connect code to end users.
* **Prototype Quickly**: It's cheaper to write and draw before implementing a single line of code! Rapidly prototype with some sharpies and postits, moving stages of your pen and paper pipeline without opening your laptop.
* **Complexity Simplified**: Big Picture helps bring the non techies into the mix by showing them the components required to manage the softwares lifecycle. Build it up one step at a time to demonstrate the complexity in a simple visual flow.
* **Information Radiator**: As the complexity of a software delivery pipeline grows, the Big Picture should be updated to reflect this.
