## Everything As Code



### Everything As Code
#### _What Is It?_
The idea of Everything As Code (EaC) engages each layer of the stack in writing infrastructure as software, where everything is expressed with code.



### Everything As Code
#### _What Is Everything?_
* Architecture as code
* Projects as code + Scaffolding
* Application environment as code
* Version Control
* Test automation
* Build automation & dependency management
* Configuration Management
* Container / Cluster orchestrators
* Security & Compliance
* Policy as code / Compliance as code



### Everything As Code
#### _What Is It?_
EaC provides our infrastructures, workflows, and services a mature, programmatic, and resilient pattern:

* Secure and upgradable
* Consistent in its predicatbility 
* Version controlled
* Maintainable, testable, and collaborative
* Modular, composable, and separate
* Auto-scalable
* Immutable
* Graceful self-healing



### Everything As Code
#### Why use Everything As Code approach?
Benefits of using Everything as Code principles:

* **Knowledge and understanding of the environment**: Provides a complete insight into your infrastructure, configurations, and policies without manually updating diagrams.
* **Automated Monitoring**: Results in the ability to automatically deploy and update components without any manual intervention.
* **Infrastructure on Demand**: Deploy infrastructure whenever it's required by ntegrating into a DevOps pipeline to dynamically build and destroy environments as the pipeline executes.
* **GitOps**: A bridge for development and production where Git is the source of truth all code can be analyzed for potential errors. Version control simplifies rollbacks.
* **Consistency**: Migrations, deployments and configuration changes are easy to replicate.
